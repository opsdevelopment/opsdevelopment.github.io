  <div>

    <p>
        Is your Gear S3 giving up because the battery is getting old, but you don't want to spend another three to four hundred on a new watch.  One of our staff had the same issue and after
        searching everywhere to find someone who could replace it and failing, he decided to do it himself.  If you would like us to replace the battery in your Gear S3 it is $30 dollars for us to 
        get the battery and have everything set up for the change; then another $30 if the switch is successful (not including shipping if you are outside of Northern Colorado).  These batteries were put together by machines and not intended to have the 
        battery replaced by hand.  If there is anything inside your watch that is in sub-optimal condition there is a chance that it will break when opened.  With that in mind we make no guarantees 
        that the batter switch will be successful, or bring your watch back to its old glory.  We also cannot guarantee that your watch will not be destroyed when we open it up.  For more information please 
        send us an email and we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
